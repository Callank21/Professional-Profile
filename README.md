# Professional-Profile

## Description

A central website linking out all my projects for professional purposes. Demonstrates my range of skills and abilities with various web development technologies. I created a responsive website using flexbox so that my website can be viewed on various screen sizes. I learned how to properly manipulate flexbox CSS elements and got a deeper understanding of front-end workflow.
